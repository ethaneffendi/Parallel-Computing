  <h1 class="text">Threads and Processes in Python</h1>
  <p class="text">
    In Python, a running instance of a full application is called a process.
    One process can be broken up into many smaller tasks that work together to make the full app run smoothly.
    These smaller tasks are called threads.
    The operating system a process is being run in manages how and when threads are executed.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    Single-threading is the practice of having the multiple threads in one process run sequentially.
    Each thread waits for the one before it to finish before executing.
    If one thread takes a long time to execute, however, it becomes a bottleneck.
    The solution to this inefficiency is multithreading.
    Multithreading is the practice of allowing more than one thread to execute simultaneously.
    In particular, multiple threads are executed simultaneously using a technique called time slicing.
    The CPU switches between working on different threads so quickly that it seems as though the threads are running in parallel.
    Threads in the same process share the same resources (namely memory), so synchronization is necessary.
    Mechanisms exist for ensuring that no more than one concurrent thread can process and execute a particular portion of a program at once.
    Restricting execution of these special portions of code, called critical sections, to one thread at a time prevents data conflicts that might happen when two or more threads are reading and writing from the same shared memory.
    For working with threads and implementing multithreading, Python has a module called <code>threading</code>.
